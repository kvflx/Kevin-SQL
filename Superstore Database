#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database and get information about some of the items sold at the store, including their prices, categories, stock, etc.

#In this query, I obtained information about the table's visual structure, which would then help me have a better understanding of how to approach my future queries. I limited the query by 5 lines as best practice in the case the database might be large enough to cause performance issues.
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY PRICE DESC
LIMIT 5;

#In this query, I was in search of the total price of each category within the database. 
SELECT SUM(price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

#In this query, I found information on the highest priced item within the "Kitchen Supplies" category.
SELECT MAX(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category = "Kitchen Supplies";

#In this query, I found information that helped me understand the quantity of stock within each category.
SELECT stock_quantity, category
FROM superstore
ORDER BY category;
