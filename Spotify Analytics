# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into and answer analytical questions using SQL.

#Table Creation
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#After this, I inserted the data into the table from a csv file

#Finally, I explored the data with the following SQL.

#1. What is the average liveness of songs with at least a 90 popularity score?
SELECT avg(liveness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90;

#2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#3. What are ten least popular tracks, who sang them and what was their popularity score?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity asc
LIMIT 10;

#4. Find songs by artists whose names start with 'D'.
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE 'D%'
GROUP BY artist_name;

#5. How many tracks in the database are from Doja Cat and what is their average popularity?

SELECT COUNT(track_name), AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat';

#6. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

#Or it could also be done this way:

SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
