#In this analysis I queried a database with multiple tables and used these queries to quantify statistics pertaining to customer and order data.

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = "iPhone"

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as feb

WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct MIN(price), product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, ROUND(SUM(quantity * price),2) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product,
SUM(quantity),
SUM(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT distinct COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT distinct product,
SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT DISTINCT orderID, orderdate, location
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%%New York%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >=3;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) as total_sold 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Headphone%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT SUM(price*quantity)/COUNT(acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity)/COUNT(acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price) as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1;
